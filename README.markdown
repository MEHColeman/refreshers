# Refreshers

I use a lot of tools at work, with lots of different, useful, rarely used
features and shortcuts.  I found myself making a lot of notes and having to
refer to them often, because I don't use these feature enough to fix them in
my muscle memory.

So, this is a set of practice files with examples of features I want to
remember. Just read through the file and complete the steps. Hints for the
commands needed for each feature are included, but can be hidden by using
indented folds.
